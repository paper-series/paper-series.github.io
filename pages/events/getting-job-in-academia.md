<a target=_blank href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~zhangqian/">Qian Zhang | Soon: Professor at UC Riverside</a><br>

Qian is a postdoc at UCLA working with Prof. Miryung Kim. She got her Ph.D. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in Dec. 2017, adviced by Prof. Johnny Qiang Xu. Her research lies at the intersection of software engineering, heterogeneous hardware design, and data-intensive scalable computing (DISC) systems. Currently, she is working on interactive human-in-the-loop design space exploration for heterogeneous computing with FPGAs, and an offloading runtime with input guard synthesis for heterogeneous computing.
