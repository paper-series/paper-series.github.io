## Getting started with systems research
Panel on getting started with research

We are organizing a panel with senior students in the area of Computer Systems to talk about their experience as systems researchers. The panel will specifically focus on students who are getting started in the field of CS research. We will answer questions from broad areas including:
1. How to get started with research in systems as an undergraduate or a young PhD student
2. Managing your relationship and expectations with your your adviser, mentor and peers.
3. What to expect during your PhD.
4. How to get from starting a project to a publication.

The panel will be a one hour live session with pre-sourced questions and live discussion. All student in interested in the area of systems research or related CS fields is invited to join and ask questions!

* **When**:
  * The session will be live on Zoom and streamed on YouTube and Twitch.  
  **Tentative: between May 12-15, 2022**

<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eruppel/">Emily Ruppel | PhD Student, CMU</a><br>
Emily Ruppel is a final-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Brandon Lucia. She researches and builds batteryless, energy harvesting systems that perform perform computationally intensive tasks despite frequent power failures. Her recent work examines runtime software and programming models that allow batteryless devices to correctly interact with their physical environment. She is currently serving as co-chair of the Computer Architecture Long-term Mentoring (CALM) committee.

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gururajshome/home">Gururaj Saileshwar | Phd Student, Georgia Tech</a><br>
Gururaj Saileshwar is a graduating Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech, Atlanta, USA, advised by Prof. Moinuddin Qureshi. His research is at the intersection of computer architecture and security, including topics like cache side-channels, transient execution attacks, memory integrity, and memory safety. Recently, Gururaj has helped co-organize Meet-A-Senior-Architect and Meet-A-Senior-Student with Joel Emer and CASA at several computer architecture conferences. He is also a part of the organizing committee for CALM which is initiating a long-term mentoring program in computer architecture.

<a href="https://www.stewartgrant.ca/">Stewart Grant | PhD student, UC San Diego</a><br>
Stewart is a 4th Year PhD student working in the systems and networking group with Alex Snoeren at UCSD. His work is focused on sharing and isolation in the context of SmartNICs and disaggregated memory. You can most likely find him benchmarking RDMA and DPDK code on the third floor. Within the department he has assisted as lead on the faculty candidate student panel, and mentored undergraduates through the ERSP program.  Extraciricurly Stewart is usually rock climbing or running. Quote - "Let's Bail".

<a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~zhangqian/">Qian Zhang | Post Doc, UCLA</a><br>
Qian Zhang is a postdoctoral researcher in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her research reinvents software tools for emerging computing paradigms such as FPGA-based heterogeneous computing to improve developer productivity. This field of study brings together a unique combination of ideas from software engineering and hardware systems. Her postdoc work has been published at ESEC/FSE, ASPLOS, ICSE, ASE. Before UCLA, she received her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Her PhD work has been published at DAC, ICCAD, DATE, TCAD. She was the recipient of the University Fellowship for Academic Excellence and the Distinguished Academic Performance Scholarship in Hong Kong. She has also been selected as one of the MIT EECS Rising Stars in 2021.
