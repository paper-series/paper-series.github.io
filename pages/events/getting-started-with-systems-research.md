## Getting started with systems research
Panel on getting started with research

We are organizing a panel with senior students in the area of Computer Systems
to talk about their experience as systems researchers. The panel will
specifically focus on students who are getting started in the field of CS
research. 

We will answer questions from broad areas including:

1. How to get started with research in systems as an undergraduate or a young PhD student?
2. Managing your relationship and expectations with your your adviser, mentor and peers?
3. What to expect during your PhD?
4. How to get from starting a project to a publication?

The panel will be a one hour live session with pre-sourced questions and live
discussion. All student in interested in the area of systems research or related
CS fields is invited to join and ask questions!

<a target=_blank href="https://www.stewartgrant.ca/">Stewart Grant | PhD student, UC San Diego</a><br>

Stewart is a 4th Year PhD student working in the systems and networking group
with Alex Snoeren at UCSD. His work is focused on sharing and isolation in the
context of SmartNICs and disaggregated memory. You can most likely find him
benchmarking RDMA and DPDK code on the third floor. Within the department he has
assisted as lead on the faculty candidate student panel, and mentored
undergraduates through the ERSP program.  Extraciricurly Stewart is usually rock
climbing or running. Quote - "Let's Bail".

<a target=_blank href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eruppel/">Emily Ruppel | PhD Student, CMU</a><br>

Emily Ruppel is a final-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University advised
by Brandon Lucia. She researches and builds batteryless, energy harvesting
systems that perform perform computationally intensive tasks despite frequent
power failures. Her recent work examines runtime software and programming models
that allow batteryless devices to correctly interact with their physical
environment. She is currently serving as co-chair of the Computer Architecture
Long-term Mentoring (CALM) committee.

Gururaj Saileshwar is a graduating Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech, Atlanta, USA,
advised by Prof. Moinuddin Qureshi. His research is at the intersection of
computer architecture and security, including topics like cache side-channels,
transient execution attacks, memory integrity, and memory safety. Recently,
Gururaj has helped co-organize Meet-A-Senior-Architect and Meet-A-Senior-Student
with Joel Emer and CASA at several computer architecture conferences. He is also
a part of the organizing committee for CALM which is initiating a long-term
mentoring program in computer architecture.
