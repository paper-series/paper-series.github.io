## A Panel on Fellowships

We are organizing a panel to help graduate students in Computer Science and related fields with Fellowships.
The panelists will include people who have won various fellowships in the past.

The panel will be a one-hour live session with pre-sourced questions and live
discussion. All students interested in getting a fellowship are
invited to join and ask questions!
